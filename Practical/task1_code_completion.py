üß† Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

This script compares an AI-generated Python function (simulated using GitHub Copilot-style logic)
with a manually written version. The goal is to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key
and evaluate which version is more efficient and readable.

# üìù 200-Word Analysis
analysis = """
Both the AI-generated and manual functions successfully sort a list of dictionaries by a specified key.
The AI version, simulated using GitHub Copilot-style logic, is concise and uses Python‚Äôs built-in
sorted() function with a lambda expression. It performs well and is syntactically correct, but lacks
documentation and error handling.

The manual version includes a docstring and basic error handling for missing keys and incorrect data types,
making it more robust and user-friendly. In terms of performance, both versions are nearly identical for
small datasets, though the AI version may be slightly faster due to its minimal structure.

Overall, the AI-generated code is efficient and saves time, especially for simple tasks. However, it still
requires human oversight to ensure readability, maintainability, and resilience to edge cases. In a real-world
project, I would use the AI suggestion as a starting point and refine it to meet production standards.
This exercise shows how AI can accelerate development while still benefiting from human review and refinement.
